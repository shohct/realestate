```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r data, include = FALSE}

# Read data from Github to conduct analysis

library(RCurl)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shohct/realestate/master/RealestateData.csv")
data <- read_csv(url)
```

## Preliminary EDA on real estate data

```{r EDA, echo = FALSE}
data %>% 
  select(SoldPrice, AskingPrice, Bed, Sqft, Age, DaysOnMarket, PriceSqft) %>% 
  split(.$Bed) %>% 
  map(summary)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
